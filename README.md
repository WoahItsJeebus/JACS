- ### Anti-AFK
  - This script will look for an active Roblox process, focus it, click the center of the window, and return to the previously active window (if any), repeats every 15 minutes unless specified otherwise.
- ### Sound notifier
  - For when the above described auto-clicker is about to repeat its loop
  - I unfortunately cannot control how loud the beeps are (at least with my current knowledge on AHK), **they can be loud in some headsets/speakers!**
- ### Easy to use interface
  - No keybinds involved. Simply toggle the auto-clicker and continue with what you were doing!
- ### Progress bar & time tracking
  - See how long until the next auto-click!

  VirusTotal Scan Results:
  - My script has been scanned using VirusTotal. One out of numerous antivirus engines flagged the executable, which is a known false positive associated with AutoHotkey scripts. I have submitted a report to the vendor for reevaluation.
